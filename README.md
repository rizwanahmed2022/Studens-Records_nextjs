# **Student Records Management System**

This is a small practice project built using **Next.js** and **JavaScript**. The application allows users to manage student records without using a database. Instead, it utilizes JavaScript objects for storing and retrieving data.

## **Features**

1. **Add Student Information**  
   Users can enter student details (like name and class) and receive a unique tracking ID for future reference.

2. **Search Student Record**  
   Users can search for a student's information using the tracking ID.

3. **View All Records**  
   Users can view all student records stored in the system.

---

## **How It Works**

1. Data is stored in JavaScript objects, and each record is assigned a unique tracking ID.
2. Records are added, searched, and displayed directly from the JavaScript objects.
3. Note: All data is stored in memory and will reset if the browser is refreshed.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Next.js**: For building the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For handling logic and storing records.

## **Disclaimer**

This project is for practice purposes and does not include persistent data storage. All records are temporary and exist only during the browser session.
